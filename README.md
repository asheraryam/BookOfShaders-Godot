The reset button returns edited shaders to their default code.

To reset all shaders to the default shader code, delete the shaders folder in the user directory and reopen the application.

Create new folders and new shader code in the user directory.

*WARNING*: Automatic saving during runtime will overwrite external editor changes.
If using an external text editor, this application should be closed first.
